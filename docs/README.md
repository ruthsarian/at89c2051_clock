There is two versions of this clock kit.  
  1.  schematic.jpg and unassembled kit.jpg    describe the original kit that this repository is based from.
  2.  Clock-schematic-V2.png and Clock-picture-v2.png    are a different kit that has a slightly different wiring.

The V2 kit can be made to work by cutting 2 traces and adding bodge wires.
you could probably alter all the code to make it work without cutting traces, but that would make the build process 
more complicated, so I elected not to go this route, just add bodge wires.
